# Slide 1: Introduction to Energy in Biological Systems

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand different sources of energy for biological organisms, distinguishing between autotrophs and heterotrophs.
- Grasp the 1st and 2nd Laws of Thermodynamics.
- Understand the interconversion of energy within a cell.
- Learn the definition of Gibbs free energy and its role in spontaneous reactions.

# Slide 2: Flow of Energy Drives All Life Processes

- **Unidirectional Flow of Energy**: From the sun's fusion reactions to the environment.
- **Process**:
  - Starts with high-energy compounds produced via photosynthesis.
  - Energy released as needed in oxidation reactions across all life forms.
- **Concept**: Photons in, Heat out.

# Slide 3: Energy Flows Through the Biosphere Continuously

- **Oxidation and Reduction**:
  - Oxidation involves removing electrons, typically with hydrogen atoms, releasing energy.
  - Reduction involves adding electrons, usually with hydrogen atoms, and requires energy input.
- **Mnemonic**: OILRIG (Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain).

# Slide 4: Examples of Oxidation and Reduction

- **Oxidation Examples**:
  - Glucose Oxidation: \( C6H12O6 + 6O2 \rightarrow CO2 + 6H2O + \text{energy} \)
  - Methane Oxidation: \( CH4 + 2O2 \rightarrow CO2 + 2H2O + \text{energy} \)
- **Reduction Example**:
  - Carbon Dioxide Reduction: \( \text{Energy} + 6CO2 + 6H2O \rightarrow C6H12O6 + 6O2 \)
  - Note: This is the reverse of glucose oxidation.

# Slide 5: Sources of Energy for Organisms

- **Phototrophs**:
  - Transform sunlight into chemical energy.
  - Photoautotrophs produce necessary carbon compounds from CO2 (e.g., plants, cyanobacteria).
  - Photoheterotrophs use solar energy and consume organic molecules for carbon (e.g., purple non-sulfur bacteria).
- **Chemotrophs**:
  - Obtain energy by oxidizing chemical compounds.
  - Chemoautotrophs use inorganic compounds for energy and CO2 for carbon (e.g., extremophiles, archaea).
  - Chemoheterotrophs consume organic compounds for both energy and carbon (e.g., animals, fungi).

# Slide 6: The Flow of Energy in Living Things

- **Energy States**:
  - Potential Energy: Stored energy.
  - Kinetic Energy: Energy of motion.
- **Thermodynamics**: Study of energy changes, focusing on heat.
- **Applications**: Involves concentration gradients and chemical bonds.

# Slide 7: Understanding Energy Flow in Biological Systems

- **Systems**:
  - Open or Closed: Closed systems are sealed, while open systems can exchange energy with their surroundings.
  - Biological organisms are open systems, allowing energy uptake and release.
- **Energy in Biological Systems**: Considers constant variables like temperature, pressure, and volume in dilute solutions within cells.

# Slide 8: Quantifying Energy Change

- **Units**:
  - Calories: Energy needed to raise 1 gram of water by 1°C at 1 atmosphere.
  - Joules: Preferred by physicists, where 1 Joule = 0.239 calories.
- **Concepts**:
  - Caloric and joule measurements help quantify energy changes during chemical reactions.

# Slide 9: Laws of Thermodynamics in Biological Context

- **1st Law**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted (e.g., glucose oxidation).
- **2nd Law**: Total entropy always increases, indicating that entropy (disorder) tends to increase.
- **Applications**: These laws explain the flow and transformation of energy in biological systems.

# Slide 10: Gibbs Free Energy and Biological Reactions

- **Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG)**:
  - Indicates the spontaneity of reactions. Negative ΔG indicates a spontaneous reaction.
  - ΔG Equation: \( \Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S \)
  - Relates changes in enthalpy (ΔH), temperature (T), and entropy (ΔS) to predict reaction behavior.
  
# Slide 11: Applying Thermodynamics to Biological Systems

- **Reaction Equilibrium**:
  - Equilibrium constant (Keq) and its relation to Gibbs free energy.
  - Understanding how reactions approach or maintain equilibrium in biological systems.
- **Standard Conditions for ΔG**:
  - Standard conditions include standard temperature (25°C), pressure, and concentrations to define ΔG°'.

# Slide 12: Homework and Practical Applications

- **Exercises**:
  - Calculate Keq from given concentrations.
  - Analyze how changes in conditions affect ΔG and reaction direction.
- **Real-World Application**:
  - Applying these principles to understand and predict the behavior of biochemical pathways in various conditions.
