## Types of DNA Damage

- **Chemical Instability of Bases**
  - Tautomeric shift of bases:
    - Spontaneous, transient rearrangement leading to alternative pairing forms.
    - Examples: 
      - Keto <-> Enol of G and T
      - Amino <-> Imino of A and C
  - **Hydrolysis of Bases**:
    - Depurination and deamination processes, slower in guanine and adenine.

- **Damage Due to Radiation**
  - UV light causes pyrimidine dimers forming a cyclobutane ring, blocking DNA polymerase.
  - X-rays cause double-stranded breaks.

- **DNA Damage Due to Chemicals**
  - Alkylating agents (e.g., EMS, MMS) that can lead to base modifications and mutations.
  - DNA intercalating agents disrupt DNA structure and function.

## DNA Repair Mechanisms

### Single-Strand Repair

1. **Direct Repair**
   - Photolyase uses visible light and FADH cofactor to reverse cyclobutane dimers.
   - Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase repairs alkylated guanine.

2. **Base Excision Repair (BER)**
   - Glycosylases remove damaged bases, leaving the sugar backbone intact.
   - AP-endonuclease cuts the DNA near the damaged site, followed by resynthesis and ligation.

3. **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**
   - Recognizes bulky helix-distorting lesions like pyrimidine dimers.
   - Involves DNA damage detection, excision of damaged strands, and resynthesis.

4. **Mismatch Repair**
   - Fixes errors that escape proofreading during DNA replication.
   - Involves recognition of mismatches, removal of a DNA segment, and resynthesis.

5. **Translesion Synthesis**
   - Y-family polymerases synthesize over the template strand containing lesions.

### Double-Strand Break Repair (DSBR)

1. **Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)**
   - Quick repair that may introduce mutations (deletions).

2. **Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)**
   - Uses a homologous sequence as a template for accurate repair.

## Highlights

- "DNA damage is primarily repaired through mechanisms like base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and mismatch repair, crucial for maintaining genetic stability."
- "Enzymes involved in the repair process can recognize damaged DNA through structural distortions that arise upon lesion formation."
- "Failure to repair DNA damage can lead to mutations, which accumulate and contribute to diseases such as cancer."
