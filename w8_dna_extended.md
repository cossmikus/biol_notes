# Nomenclature
- **Nucleoside**: The sugar-base portion of a nucleotide.
- **Nucleoside Monophosphate (NMP)**: A nucleoside with one phosphate (e.g., Adenosine Monophosphate, AMP).
- **ADP**: Adenosine Diphosphate.
- **ATP**: Adenosine Triphosphate.

# Other Functions of Nucleotides
- ATP: Acts as the energy currency of the cell.
- Electron and functional group carriers: NADH, NADPH.

# ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)
- Primary molecule for transferring energy in metabolic reactions.
- Contains high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds, the breakage of which releases energy.

# NADH and NADPH
- **Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH)**: Carries electrons for catabolic reactions.
- **Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH)**: Provides electrons for anabolic reactions.

# NADH vs NADPH
- Both carry electrons but serve different enzymatic reactions:
  - NADPH is used in anabolic reactions to supply electrons.
  - NADH is involved in catabolic reactions and acts as an oxidizing agent.

# Coenzyme A (CoA)
- Serves as an activated carrier transferring acetyl groups.
- Participates in the Citric Acid Cycle and fatty acid biosynthesis.

# The Polymers Are DNA and RNA
- Nucleic acids are linear polymers of nucleotides linked by phosphodiester bridges:
  - 5' phosphate of one nucleotide is joined to the 3' hydroxyl group of the next.
- Directionality:
  - 5' phosphate group at one end and a 3' hydroxyl group at the other.
  - Nucleotide sequences are conventionally written in the 5' to 3' direction.

# DNA and RNA Differences
- **Chemical Differences**:
  - RNA contains the sugar ribose.
  - DNA contains the sugar deoxyribose.
- **Functional Differences**:
  - DNA is primarily the repository of genetic information.
  - RNA is involved in the expression of genetic information.

# Watson and Crick - DNA Is a Double Helix
- Key Insights:
  - DNA structure includes a sugar-phosphate backbone with nitrogenous bases.
  - Bases capable of forming hydrogen bonds at physiological pH.
  - X-ray diffraction data by Rosalind Franklin suggested a helical structure.
- Proposed the double helix model in 1953 based on accumulated data.

# DNA Molecule Is a Double-Stranded Helix
- Two antiparallel and complementary strands of DNA twist around a common axis.
- This structure suggested a mechanism for DNA replication.

# Key Features of DNA Structure
- The DNA strands are twisted around each other, creating:
  - A major groove
  - A minor groove
- Strands are antiparallel:
  - 5’ to 3’ in one strand.
  - 3’ to 5’ in the opposite strand.

# The Watson-Crick Model
- Structural Aspects:
  - Sugar-phosphate backbones on the outside of the helix.
  - Nitrogenous bases on the inside.
  - 10 nucleotide pairs per complete turn of the helix.
  - Distance between nucleotide pairs: 0.34 nm.
  - Helix diameter: 2 nm.

# Complementary Base Pairing
- Strands are complementary to each other:
  - Adenine (A) forms two hydrogen bonds with Thymine (T).
  - Guanine (G) forms three hydrogen bonds with Cytosine (C).

# Chargaff’s Rules Reveal That A = T and G = C
- Erwin Chargaff used chromatographic methods to separate and quantify bases.
- Found that the amount of Adenine equals Thymine, and the amount of Guanine equals Cytosine across all DNA samples, known as Chargaff’s rule.

# Structural Variants of DNA
- **B-DNA**: The common right-handed helix.
- **Z-DNA**: A left-handed helix.

# Other Forms of DNA
- **A-DNA**: A right-handed helix that is shorter and thicker than B-DNA.
- **RNA double helices**: Typically adopt an A-form.

# DNA Can Be Interconverted Between Relaxed and Supercoiled Forms
- DNA double helix can twist upon itself to form supercoiled DNA:
  - Positive supercoil: Right-hand twist.
  - Negative supercoil: Left-hand twist.

# Supercoiling
- Occurs in both linear and circular DNA molecules.
- More easily studied in circular DNA.
- DNA can transition between supercoiled and relaxed states.
- Supercoiling helps compact chromosomal DNA within cells.

# Interconversion Between Relaxed and Supercoiled DNA
- **Topoisomerases**: Enzymes that relax supercoils.
  - Type I topoisomerases introduce single-strand breaks.
  - Type II topoisomerases introduce double-strand breaks (e.g., DNA gyrase in bacteria).

# Interconversion Between Relaxed and Supercoiled DNA
- **Topoisomerases**: Enzymes that relax supercoils.
  - Type I topoisomerases introduce single-strand breaks.
  - Type II topoisomerases introduce double-strand breaks (e.g., DNA gyrase in bacteria).

# Denaturation – Separation of Two Strands
- DNA melting temperature (Tm) is the temperature at which half of the DNA strands are separated.
- Higher nucleotide GC content generally results in a higher Tm.

# Reannealing of Complementary DNA Strands
- The two complementary strands of DNA can be reannealed.
- **Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)**: A technique used to identify nucleic acids based on sequence using a probe (e.g., recognizing TTAGGG repeats).

# DNA Packaging Is a Challenge for All Forms of Life
- **Bacterial DNA Packaging**:
  - Bacteria typically have a single, usually circular chromosome.
  - DNA is highly compacted and folded into loops, held in place by nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs).

# Eukaryotic DNA Packaging
- **Chromatin**: DNA complexed with histone proteins and a small amount of RNA.
  - During cell division, chromatin fibers condense into chromosomes.
- **Interphase Chromatin and Mitotic Chromosome**: Different structural states of chromatin.

# Levels of Chromatin Packaging
- **Nucleosome**: DNA wrapped around a histone octamer, forming the basic unit of DNA packaging.
- **30-nm Fiber**: Nucleosomes fold into a more compact structure, aided by Histone H1.
- **Loops and Domains**: Further folding and organization into higher-order structures.

# Histone Modifications and Chromosome Visibility
- Histones undergo various post-translational modifications affecting DNA accessibility and transcription.
- **Chromosomes** become visible during cell division as they are tightly packed and stained.

# Human Genome and Chromosomes
- **Diploid (2N)**: Somatic cells have 46 chromosomes (22 autosomal pairs and 1 pair of sex chromosomes).
- **Haploid (N)**: Gametes (sex cells) have 23 chromosomes.
- Chromosomes can be identified by unique banding patterns using stains like Giemsa.

# Chromosomal DNA Contains Euchromatin and Heterochromatin
- **Euchromatin**: Loosely packed and transcriptionally active chromatin, allowing gene expression.
- **Heterochromatin**: Highly compacted and transcriptionally inactive chromatin, often seen as dark spots in micrographs.

# Role of Heterochromatin
- **Facultative Heterochromatin**: Can be converted to euchromatin and vice versa, e.g., Barr body.
- **Constitutive Heterochromatin**: Permanently compacted and has structural functions within chromosomes, including centromeres and telomeres.

# Centromeres and Telomeres
- **Centromeres**: Maintain sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis and meiosis, providing attachment points for spindle microtubules.
  - Characterized by repetitive DNA sequences.
  - In fruit flies, centromeric chromatin includes a histone H3 variant called CENP-A.
- **Telomeres**: Protective structures at the tips of chromosomes, composed of repetitive DNA sequences that protect chromosome ends from degradation.

# X Chromosome Inactivation
- In female mammals, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated to prevent a double dose of X chromosome products, which would be lethal.
- This inactivation results in one X chromosome being active (euchromatin) and the other being inactive (heterochromatin, forming a Barr body).

# X Chromosomal Inactivation in Cats
- The orange and black pattern on tortoiseshell cats is due to X chromosome inactivation, leading to a patchy distribution of fur color depending on which X chromosome is active.


# Mosaicism from X-Chromosomal Inactivation
- X-chromosomal inactivation can lead to mosaicism, where cells within the same organism show different genetic expressions based on which X chromosome is active.

# The Histone Code
- Histones are modified by the addition of methyl, acetyl, phosphate, or other groups to their tails, affecting chromatin structure and gene expression.
- These modifications constitute a "histone code" that can regulate DNA accessibility and transcriptional activity.

# Histone Modifications
- Modifications such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination influence chromatin structure:
  - **Acetylation** generally loosens DNA-histone interactions, facilitating transcription.
  - **Methylation** can either activate or repress transcription, depending on the site and state of methylation.

# Chromatin Remodeling
- Chromatin remodeling involves altering the position of nucleosomes along DNA to make certain regions more accessible for transcription.
- **SWI/SNF Family**: A class of chromatin remodelers that can slide nucleosomes or remove them, altering chromatin structure.

# Summary of DNA Structure and Function
- DNA and RNA are nucleic acids that play critical roles in genetic information storage, transmission, and expression.
- Chromatin structure is dynamic and regulated through mechanisms like histone modifications and chromatin remodeling, affecting gene expression and cellular function.
