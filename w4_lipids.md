  - Mostly non-polar but some are amphipathic with both polar and nonpolar regions.
- **Diverse Functions**: Involved in structure (membranes), energy storage, signaling, and more.

# Slide 3: Functions of Lipids

- **Energy Storage**: Act as compact energy reserves.
- **Membrane Structure**: Fundamental components of cellular membranes.
- **Signaling**: Include steroid hormones and other signaling molecules.
- **Electron Transport**: Involve compounds like coenzyme Q.
- **Pigments and Antioxidants**: Include substances like vitamin E which serve as antioxidants.

# Slide 4: The Main Classes of Lipids

- **Fatty Acids**: Basic building blocks containing a long hydrocarbon chain and a carboxyl group.
- **Triacylglycerols (TAGs)**: Composed of glycerol linked to three fatty acids.
- **Phospholipids**: Major components of cell membranes.
- **Glycolipids**: Lipids with carbohydrate attachments.
- **Steroids**: Include hormones and cholesterol.
- **Terpenes**: Include vitamin A and other isoprenoid compounds.

# Slide 5: Fatty Acids - Building Blocks

- **Structure**:
  - Amphipathic molecules with a polar carboxyl head and a nonpolar hydrocarbon tail.
  - Tails vary in length, typically 12-20 carbons, usually even-numbered.
- **Energy Content**:
  - Highly reduced, providing significant energy upon oxidation.

# Slide 6: Fatty Acid Types

- **Saturated Fatty Acids**: Have no double bonds; chains pack tightly and are solid at room temperature.
- **Unsaturated Fatty Acids**: Contain one or more double bonds causing bends in the chain, which prevents tight packing and makes them liquid at room temperature.

# Slide 7: Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

- **Example**: Linoleate, an 18-carbon fatty acid with two double bonds.
- **Significance**: Essential fatty acids that must be obtained from the diet.

# Slide 8: Fatty Acids in Membrane Structure and Function

- **Role**: Hydrocarbon tails provide a barrier to the diffusion of polar molecules.
- **Membrane Fluidity**:
  - Saturated fatty acids result in a more rigid membrane.
  - Unsaturated fatty acids, due to kinks from double bonds, lead to more fluid membranes.

# Slide 9: Triacylglycerols - Energy Storage Lipids

- **Structure**:
  - Glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached via ester bonds.
- **Function**:
  - Primary storage form of lipids due to their energy density.

# Slide 10: Fats and Oils

- **Fats**: Mostly saturated triacylglycerols, solid or semisolid at room temperature.
- **Oils**: Mostly unsaturated triacylglycerols, liquid at room temperature.
- **Source**: Fats are typically animal-derived, while oils are plant-derived.

# Slide 11: Phospholipids - Abundant in Membranes

- **Types**:
  - Phosphoglycerides: Derived from glycerol.
  - Sphingolipids: Derived from the amino alcohol sphingosine.
- **Function**:
  - Contribute to the bilayer structure of membranes due to their amphipathic nature.

# Slide 12: Glycolipids - Specialized Membrane Components

- **Structure**:
  - Lipids with one or more carbohydrate groups attached.
- **Location**:
  - Predominantly found in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane.
- **Function**:
  - Participate in cell recognition and interaction.

# Slide 13: Steroids - Various Functions

- **Basic Structure**:
  - Four-ring hydrocarbon skeleton.
- **Types**:
  - Cholesterol: A component of cell membranes.
  - Hormones: Including sex hormones and corticosteroids.

# Slide 14: Terpenes - Derived from Isoprene

- **Structure**:
  - Built from the five-carbon compound isoprene.
- **Examples**:
  - Vitamin A and carotenoids.
- **Functions**:
  - Involved in a variety of biological functions including vision and antioxidant activity.

# Slide 15: Biological Membranes

- **Definition**: Biological membranes are thin layers composed primarily of lipids and proteins that enclose cells and internal organelles.
- **Composition**: Mainly a lipid bilayer interspersed with various proteins, often containing sterols like cholesterol.
- **Properties**: The lipid bilayer is fluid, allowing lateral movement of lipids and some proteins within the plane of the membrane.

# Slide 16: Major Classes of Membrane Lipids

- **Phospholipids**: The most abundant lipids in cell membranes, crucial for creating a bilayer due to their amphipathic nature.
- **Glycolipids**: Contribute to cell recognition on the extracellular surface of the cell membrane.
- **Sterols**: Such as cholesterol, which modulates fluidity and stability of the membrane.

# Slide 17: Lipid Bilayer Asymmetry

- **Asymmetry in Lipid Distribution**:
  - Different types of phospholipids are distributed unequally between the two layers of the bilayer.
  - Glycolipids are typically found only in the outer layer of the plasma membrane.
- **Functional Importance**:
  - Asymmetry is crucial for various cell functions, including signaling and maintaining the cell's internal environment.

# Slide 18: Selective Permeability of Lipid Bilayers

- **Permeability**:
  - Lipid bilayers are highly impermeable to ions and most polar molecules.
  - Nonpolar molecules and small polar molecules can diffuse more readily through the membrane.
- **Mechanisms**:
  - Transport proteins facilitate the movement of substances that cannot diffuse across the bilayer on their own.

# Slide 19: Passive Membrane Transport

- **Simple Diffusion**:
  - Movement of substances from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration without the need for energy input.
- **Osmosis**:
  - The diffusion of water across a semipermeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration.

# Slide 20: Osmosis and Water Movement

- **Aquaporins**:
  - Specialized membrane proteins that facilitate water transport across cell membranes.
- **Osmotic Pressure**:
  - The pressure required to prevent water from moving across a membrane by osmosis.

# Slide 21: Osmotic Balance and Cell Environment

- **Cellular Osmotic Environment**:
  - Cells maintain osmotic balance through various mechanisms to prevent excessive swelling or shrinking.
- **Role of Cell Walls in Plants**:
  - Provide structural support and limit the volume of water entering the cells, thus maintaining osmotic balance.

# Slide 22: Tonicity and Cell Behavior

- **Hypotonic, Isotonic, and Hypertonic Solutions**:
  - Hypotonic solutions cause cells to swell, isotonic solutions result in no net water movement, and hypertonic solutions cause cells to shrink.
- **Relevance**:
  - Understanding tonicity is crucial for medical treatments involving fluids and for understanding cell health and behavior.

# Slide 23: Summary and Conclusions

- **Review of Lipid Functions and Properties**:
  - Lipids play critical roles in energy storage, membrane structure, and cell signaling.
- **Importance of Membrane Integrity**:
  - The structural integrity and function of membranes are essential for the life of the cell, influencing various physiological processes.
