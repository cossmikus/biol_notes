# Introduction to Transcription

- **Chapters**: ECB Chapter 7, BWC Chapter 18
- **Overview**:
  - Transcription in prokaryotes
  - Transcription in eukaryotes
- **Templates**:
  - DNA acts as the template for RNA synthesis.
  - RNA acts as the template for protein synthesis (translation).

# Gene Expression Overview

- **Processes Involved**:
  - Transcription: Copying information from DNA to RNA.
  - Translation: Converting RNA information into proteins.
- **Functional Units**: Genes, which encode polypeptides or functional RNA.

# Transcription Basics

- **Nucleotide Language**:
  - RNA synthesis involves reading DNA nucleotides to synthesize RNA.
  - Differences include sugar type and the substitution of Thymine (T) with Uracil (U) in RNA.

# Transcription Mechanism

- **Features**:
  - Coding strand is in the 5’-3’ orientation.
  - RNA is complementary to the non-coding (anti-sense) strand.
- **Process**:
  - DNA unwinds, and RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA in a 5’-3’ direction, using DNA as a template.

# Transcription vs. Replication

## Similarities:
- Both processes involve unwinding of DNA.
- Both synthesize new strands in the 5’-3’ direction.

## Differences:
- Transcription results in RNA, single-stranded and shorter.
- In replication, DNA remains hydrogen-bonded to the new DNA strand.


# Transcription in Prokaryotes

- **Key Features**:
  - RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to promoter sequences.
  - Involves stages: Initiation, Elongation, and Termination.
  - Termination can be Rho-dependent or Rho-independent.

# Molecular Players in Prokaryotic Transcription

- **Components**:
  - RNA Polymerase core enzyme, polymerizing 5’ to 3’ without a primer.
  - Sigma factor for promoter recognition and initiation.
  - Terminator proteins +/- Rho.

# Transcription Start and Stop Signals

- **Function**:
  - Guide RNA polymerase on where to start and stop transcription.
- **Consensus Sequence**:
  - An idealized sequence that shows common patterns found across many genes and species.

# Transcription in Eukaryotes

- **Complexity**:
  - Involves multiple RNA polymerases.
  - Promoter regions are more varied and may be located upstream or downstream.
  - Requires transcription factors for initiation.

# Differences in Eukaryotic Transcription

- **RNA Polymerases**:
  - Different RNA polymerases transcribe different classes of RNA.
- **Promoters**:
  - More complex than in prokaryotes, involving multiple elements like TATA box, BRE, and DPE.

# Transcription Process Overview

- **Stages of Transcription**:
  - **Initiation**: RNA polymerase binds to the promoter, unwinding the DNA.
  - **Elongation**: RNA polymerase moves along the DNA, synthesizing RNA from the template strand.
  - **Termination**: RNA polymerase stops transcription when it encounters termination signals and releases the RNA transcript.

# Transcription Elongation Details

- **Mechanics**:
  - RNA polymerase adds ribonucleotides to the growing RNA strand in a 5' to 3' direction.
  - The DNA ahead of the polymerase unwinds while the DNA behind it rewinds.

# Transcription Termination

- **Mechanism**:
  - RNA polymerase continues transcription until it encounters a termination signal.
  - Termination signals can be Rho-dependent or Rho-independent, involving specific DNA sequences that cause the polymerase to stop and release the RNA.

# Transcription in Eukaryotic Cells

- **Complexity**:
  - Involves three different RNA polymerases, each responsible for different types of RNA.
  - Eukaryotic promoters are more varied and complex than those in prokaryotes.
  - Transcription factors are essential for the binding of RNA polymerase and initiation of transcription.

# Eukaryotic vs. Prokaryotic Transcription

- **Key Differences**:
  - Eukaryotic cells have multiple RNA polymerases whereas prokaryotes typically have one.
  - Eukaryotic transcription requires a series of transcription factors; prokaryotic transcription often involves a sigma factor and simpler promoter structures.
  - Eukaryotic genes are often much larger, with more complex regulatory sequences.

# Transcription Factors in Eukaryotes

- **Role**:
  - Essential for the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the promoter.
  - Interact with specific DNA sequences to facilitate or inhibit the binding of RNA polymerase.

# Promoters for RNA Polymerase II

- **Elements**:
  - TATA box, located approximately 25 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site.
  - BRE (TFIIB recognition element), close to the TATA box.
  - DPE (downstream promoter element), situated about 30 nucleotides downstream from the start point.

# Additional Control Elements in Eukaryotes

- **Enhancers and Silencers**:
  - Can be located far from the gene they regulate.
  - Enhancers increase transcription rates, while silencers decrease them.
- **Proximal and Distal Control Elements**:
  - Located close to or far from the core promoter, these elements fine-tune the transcriptional activity of associated genes.

# RNA Polymerase III Promoters

- **Characteristics**:
  - Utilizes promoters located entirely downstream of the transcription start site.
  - Prominent in genes encoding tRNAs and 5S rRNA, with specific promoter elements such as Box A and Box B.

# RNA Polymerase II Transcription Cycle

- **Steps**:
  - RNA polymerase II, along with general transcription factors, binds to the promoter.
  - After transcription initiation, the polymerase escapes the promoter and proceeds with elongation.
  - Termination occurs following the transcription of a polyadenylation signal in the pre-mRNA, leading to cleavage of the transcript and polyadenylation.

# Eukaryotic Transcription Complexity

- **Overview**:
  - Eukaryotic transcription involves multiple stages similar to prokaryotic transcription but with additional regulatory complexities.
  - Involves three different RNA polymerases, each dedicated to transcribing specific types of RNA.
  - Transcription in eukaryotes also requires a complex assembly of transcription factors.

- **RNA Polymerase Types**:
  - **RNA Polymerase I**: Transcribes most rRNA genes (excluding 5S rRNA).
  - **RNA Polymerase II**: Transcribes all protein-coding genes, plus snoRNA, some miRNAs, and siRNAs.
  - **RNA Polymerase III**: Transcribes tRNA, 5S rRNA, and some other small RNAs.

# Transcription and Translation Separation in Eukaryotes

- **Spatial and Temporal Separation**:
  - Transcription occurs in the nucleus, whereas translation takes place in the cytoplasm.
  - This separation allows for extensive RNA processing in eukaryotes, including capping, splicing, and polyadenylation, before mRNA is exported for translation.

# RNA Polymerases in Eukaryotes

- **Function and Specificity**:
  - Each RNA polymerase has specific promoters and distinct sets of transcription factors.
  - This specialization allows for precise control over the transcription of different classes of genes.

# Promoters and Transcription Factors in Eukaryotes

- **Complex Promoter Structures**:
  - Eukaryotic promoters include a core promoter that is necessary for the transcription initiation and various regulatory elements.
  - Transcription factors bind to these elements to either enhance or repress the transcription.

- **Examples of Core Promoter Elements**:
  - **TATA Box**: Located about 25-30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site.
  - **BRE**: TFIIB recognition element, influencing the binding stability of basal transcription machinery.
  - **DPE**: Downstream promoter element, affects the efficiency of transcription initiation.

# Eukaryotic Transcription Elongation

- **Process Details**:
  - As RNA polymerase II moves along the DNA, it unwinds the double helix in front of it and re-winds it behind.
  - RNA polymerase II is capable of proofreading and correcting its work, which is crucial for maintaining the accuracy of the RNA transcript.

- **RNA Polymerase II Fidelity**:
  - Questions about how RNA polymerase II deals with potential mistakes during transcription are crucial, given the implications for gene expression accuracy and regulation.

# Termination of Transcription in Eukaryotes

- **RNA Polymerase I**:
  - Terminates transcription upon recognition of a specific 18-nucleotide terminator sequence by a specific termination factor.

- **RNA Polymerase III**:
  - Generally terminates after transcribing a short run of thymine bases, not requiring additional protein factors for termination.

- **RNA Polymerase II**:
  - Involves cleavage of the new RNA some nucleotides downstream of the AAUAAA sequence, 

# Regulatory Mechanisms and Transcription Factors

- **Complex Interactions**:
  - Transcription initiation in eukaryotes is not just about the polymerase binding to DNA; it involves complex interactions with multiple transcription factors and regulatory proteins, including enhancers and repressors, which can be located far from the promoter sites.

- **Transcriptional Machinery**:
  - Involves the assembly of a large complex including various general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II at the promoter. This assembly is necessary for the accurate initiation and regulation of gene transcription.
