# Introduction to Carbohydrates
- The most abundant biomolecules on Earth.
- Composed of polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones.
- Serve diverse functions:
  - Source of energy and energy storage.
  - Structural elements in bacterial and plant cell walls.
  - Components of extracellular matrix.
  - Involved in cell-cell recognition processes.

# Three Main Classes of Carbohydrates
- **Monosaccharides**
  - Single polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone units.
  - Example: D-glucose, the most abundant monosaccharide.
- **Oligosaccharides**
  - Short chains of monosaccharide units linked by glycosidic bonds.
  - Example: Disaccharides (e.g., sucrose consisting of D-glucose and D-fructose).
- **Polysaccharides**
  - Sugar polymers containing more than 20 monosaccharide units.
  - Can be linear (e.g., cellulose) or branched (e.g., glycogen).

# Monosaccharides
- Typically have the empirical formula (CH2O)n.
- Properties:
  - Colorless, crystalline solids.
  - Freely soluble in water.
  - Most have a sweet taste.
- Structure:
  - Backbone of an unbranched carbon chain.
  - Carbonyl group present (aldose if at the end, ketose if internal).

# Classification of Sugars
- Based on the number of carbons:
  - Trioses (three carbons)
  - Tetroses (four carbons)
  - Pentoses (five carbons)
  - Hexoses (six carbons)
  - Heptoses (seven carbons)
- Example: D-glucose is an aldohexose; D-fructose is a ketohexose.

# Stereoisomers and Chiral Centers
- **Monosaccharides** often possess asymmetric carbon atoms known as chiral centers.
- **Stereoisomers**:
  - Molecules that have the same molecular formula but differ in the spatial arrangement of atoms.
  - Example: Glyceraldehyde has one chiral center resulting in two stereoisomers.
- **Optical Isomers**:
  - Mirror images of each other.
  - Exhibit different physical properties such as rotation of plane-polarized light.

# D-Aldohexoses and Epimers
- **D-Aldohexoses**:
  - Configuration around the chiral center most distant from the carbonyl group matches D-glyceraldehyde.
- **Epimers**:
  - Sugars that differ only in the configuration around one carbon atom.
- **Glucose**:
  - Most common monosaccharide, an aldohexose.
  - Exists in equilibrium between linear and ring forms in cells.

# Formation and Types of Cyclic Forms of Glucose
- Formation of cyclic glucose via intramolecular hemiacetal formation.
- Two ring forms:
  - **α-Anomer**: Hydroxyl group on carbon number 1 points downward.
  - **β-Anomer**: Hydroxyl group on carbon number 1 points upward.
- **Mutarotation**:
  - The interconversion between α and β anomers, involving the temporary opening of the ring.

# Hexose Derivatives and Sugar Derivatives
- **Hexose Derivatives**:
  - Substitution at hydroxyl groups can change glucose into glucosamine or N-acetylglucosamine.
- **Sugar Derivatives**:
  - Reduction can produce deoxy sugars.
  - Phosphorylation of sugars, important in cellular processes like glycolysis.

# Polysaccharides
- Long chain polymers of sugars serving in structural and storage capacities.
- **Types of Polysaccharides**:
  - **Homopolysaccharides**: Consist of one type of monosaccharide (e.g., glycogen, starch, cellulose).
  - **Heteropolysaccharides**: Composed of different kinds of monosaccharide units (e.g., glycosaminoglycans).

# Glycoconjugates
- **Proteoglycans** and **Glycoproteins**:
  - Complex molecules where carbohydrates are covalently linked to proteins.
  - Play critical roles in the cell surface and extracellular matrix for structural integrity and signaling.

# Summary of Carbohydrates
- Carbohydrates include monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides.
- Essential for energy storage, structural integrity, and cellular communication.
- Exist in various forms such as linear, cyclic, α and β configurations.
- Joined by glycosidic bonds, these biomolecules perform vital storage and structural roles.
