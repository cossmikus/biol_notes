# Recombinant DNA Technology

## Overview
Recombinant DNA technology has revolutionized molecular biology, enabling the isolation, manipulation, and study of genetic material from various organisms.

## Key Techniques

### Restriction Enzymes and DNA Cloning
- **Purpose**: To produce specific DNA fragments for cloning.
- **Process**:
  - DNA is cut by restriction enzymes at specific sites, creating fragments with 'sticky ends'.
  - These fragments can be ligated to vector DNA that has been cut with the same enzyme.
- **Outcome**: Recombinant DNA that can be easily replicated within a host organism.

### Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
- **Invented**: Mid-1980s by Kary Mullis, Nobel Prize in 1993.
- **Function**: Amplifies specific DNA sequences.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Denaturation**: DNA strands are separated by heating.
  2. **Annealing**: Temperature is lowered to allow primers to bind to the DNA template.
  3. **Extension**: DNA polymerase synthesizes the new DNA strand by adding dNTPs.
- **Result**: Exponential amplification of the target DNA segment.

#### Primers in PCR
- **Length**: Typically 15-40 nucleotides.
- **Types**: Forward and reverse primers flank the target sequence to ensure specificity.

### Gene Insertion into Vectors
- **Method**:
  1. DNA fragments and vectors are cut with the same restriction enzyme.
  2. Fragments are ligated into the vectors using DNA ligase.
- **Vectors**: Commonly plasmids, which can replicate independently in bacterial cells.

### Screening and Sequencing
- **cDNA and Genomic Libraries**:
  - **Genomic Libraries**: Contain DNA fragments representing an organismâ€™s entire genome.
  - **cDNA Libraries**: Comprised of DNA copies of mRNA from the cell, reflecting gene expression at the time of extraction.
- **Screening Libraries**: Techniques like colony hybridization and PCR are used to find specific sequences within libraries.
- **Sanger Sequencing**: Used for sequencing DNA, involves chain termination with dideoxynucleotides.

## Advanced Applications

### Expression Vectors
- **Purpose**: To express foreign DNA in a host cell to produce protein.
- **Components**:
  - **Origin of Replication**: Allows replication within the host.
  - **Selectable Marker**: Confers resistance to antibiotics, used to select cells that have taken up the vector.
  - **Promoters and Coding Sequences**: Control transcription and translation of the inserted gene.

### Challenges with Expression Vectors
- **Eukaryotic Expression**: Eukaryotic proteins often require post-translational modifications which are not available in prokaryotic systems.
- **Protein Folding**: Incorrect protein folding can occur, leading to non-functional proteins.

## Summary
Recombinant DNA technology utilizes molecular tools to manipulate genetic material, enabling advancements in genetic research and biotechnology. This includes cloning, sequencing, and expressing genes, providing a foundation for further studies in genomics and molecular biology.

### Highlights

- "Recombinant DNA technology enables the study of genes from any source."
