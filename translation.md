# Translation

## Chapter 7: ECB and Chapter 19: BWC

### Overview
Translation is the biological process by which the information carried by messenger RNA (mRNA) is decoded to synthesize proteins.

### Key Concepts

#### Cracking the Code
- By the 1960s, the central dogma of molecular biology was accepted, which outlines that genes, composed of DNA, encode proteins, and mRNA serves as the intermediary.
- The genetic code format was understood to be based on triplet codons, each representing one of the 20 amino acids.

##### How the Code Was Determined
- **One Nucleotide Code:** Not feasible as it produces only 20 combinations.
- **Two Nucleotide Code:** Generates 42 combinations which are still insufficient.
- **Three Nucleotide Code:** Provides 64 combinations (enough to encode all amino acids).

#### Genetic Code Properties
- **Degenerate and Nonoverlapping:** There are 64 possible codon combinations but only 20 amino acids, indicating redundancy. The code is read in sets of three nucleotides without overlap.
- **Universal Usage:** Almost all organisms use the same genetic code, making it a universal property of life.

### Key Figures in Genetic Code Research
- **Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich Matthaei:** Pioneered the use of cell-free systems for studying protein synthesis, significantly advancing the understanding of the genetic code.

### mRNA Decoding
- Codons are read in sets of three nucleotides, with 61 codons specifying amino acids and 3 codons as stop signals.

### Molecular Players in Translation
- **mRNA:** Carries the genetic information.
- **tRNA:** Acts as the translator from mRNA codons to amino acids.
- **Ribosomes:** Facilitate the synthesis of polypeptides.

### tRNA Structure and Function
- tRNAs have a complex structure that includes an anticodon loop for recognizing mRNA codons and a 3' end for amino acid attachment.
- The structure of tRNA allows it to read the mRNA codons correctly and deliver amino acids to the ribosome.

### Mechanism of Translation
Translation involves three stages:
1. **Initiation:** Involves the assembly of ribosomes, mRNA, and the initial tRNA.
2. **Elongation:** Sequential addition of amino acids driven by codon recognition.
3. **Termination:** Concludes when a stop codon is reached, ending polypeptide synthesis.

### Translation Regulation
- **Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes:** Initiation in prokaryotes involves a formyl-methionine tRNA, whereas eukaryotes use methionine tRNA without formylation.
- **Eukaryotic Initiation:** Involves complex mechanisms using eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) and recognition of the 5' cap of the mRNA.

### Highlights

- "Each of the 20 amino acids is represented by a triplet codon from mRNA."
- "Some nucleotide triplets are never used or the code is redundant."
- "Translation is a complex, highly regulated process essential for life."
