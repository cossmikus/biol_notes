# Enzymes: The Catalysts of Life
- Enzymes are protein catalysts essential for nearly all cellular reactions.
- The presence of enzymes determines whether a reaction occurs, despite thermodynamic feasibility.
- Example: Hydrolysis of ATP (ΔG = –7.3 kcal/mol) is stable in water for several days without enzymes.

# Activation Energy Barrier
- Reactions require a minimum amount of energy, called activation energy (EA), to proceed.
- Molecules often do not react due to insufficient energy to overcome this barrier.

# Catalysts and Activation Energy
- Catalysts lower the activation energy (EA) required for reactions, facilitating the process without needing to increase the energy content of molecules.

# Transition State
- Reactants must reach a transition state with higher free energy than the reactants.
- Enzymes have the highest affinity for the transition state, helping to stabilize it and lower activation energy.

# Lowering Activation Energy
- **Proposed by Linus Pauling (1946)**: Enzymes are complementary to the transition state more than to the substrates themselves.
- This specificity helps lower the activation energy more effectively.

# Enzymes as Biological Catalysts
- Increase reaction rates by lowering the activation energy required.
- Form reversible complexes with substrates, altering the rate but not the equilibrium position of reactions.
- Do not affect the ΔG of reactions; catalyze both forward and reverse reactions.

# Enzyme Structure
- Most enzymes are globular proteins, but some RNA molecules (ribozymes) also exhibit catalytic activity.
- **Active Site**: Usually a groove or pocket that binds substrates with high affinity and where catalysis occurs.

# Active Site and Amino Acids
- Key amino acids: Cysteine, Histidine, Serine, Aspartate, Glutamate, and Lysine.
- These amino acids can bind substrates and act as proton donors or acceptors during the reaction.

# Cofactors and Prosthetic Groups
- Some enzymes require non-protein cofactors for catalytic activity, functioning as electron acceptors.
- Prosthetic groups, often metal ions or small organic molecules (coenzymes), are essential for activity.
- Coenzymes are typically derivatives of vitamins.

# Enzyme Specificity
- Enzymes exhibit high substrate specificity due to the specific shape and chemistry of their active sites.
- Unlike inorganic catalysts, which are generally nonspecific, biological enzyme reactions achieve a higher level of specificity.
- Examples:
  - **Succinate dehydrogenase** recognizes fumarate but not maleate.

# Models of Enzyme Action
- **Lock and Key Model**: The substrate fits into the enzyme's active site perfectly, like a key into a lock (Fischer model).
- **Induced-Fit Model**: Binding of the substrate induces a conformational change in the enzyme to enhance substrate interaction (Koshland model).

# Conformational Changes in Enzymes
- Substrate binding can bring distant amino acid side chains into the active site, optimizing catalysis.
- This induced conformational change ensures that the enzyme binds only the correct substrates and positions them ideally for the reaction.

# Enzyme Diversity and Nomenclature
- Thousands of enzymes have been identified, each with unique functions and specificities.
- Enzymes are named based on the substrate they act on (e.g., protease, ribonuclease, amylase) or their function (e.g., trypsin, catalase).
- **Enzyme Commission (EC)**: Enzymes are classified into six major classes based on general function.

# Six Classes of Enzymes
- **Oxidoreductases**: Involved in oxidation-reduction reactions.
- **Transferases**: Transfer functional groups between molecules.
- **Hydrolases**: Catalyze the hydrolysis of various bonds.
- **Lyases**: Break bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation.
- **Isomerases**: Catalyze the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule.
- **Ligases**: Join two molecules with covalent bonds.

# Sensitivity to Environmental Factors
- Enzymes are sensitive to changes in temperature, pH, and ionic strength which can affect their structure and function.
- Factors like molecules and ions can act as inhibitors or activators, influencing enzyme activity.

# Enzyme Activity and Temperature
- Enzyme activity increases with temperature up to a point due to enhanced kinetic energy.
- Beyond optimal temperatures, enzymes may denature, losing their activity.
- The optimal temperature for human enzymes is around 37ºC, which is normal body temperature.

# Sensitivity to pH
- Enzymes are typically active within a narrow pH range.
- pH affects the charge on amino acid residues at the active site, which can disrupt important ionic and hydrogen bonds.

# Enzyme Kinetics
- Enzyme kinetics studies the rate of substrate conversion into products under various conditions.
- Factors influencing these rates include substrate, product, and inhibitor concentrations.

# Initial Reaction Rates
- The initial reaction rates (velocity) are measured over a brief period when the substrate concentration has not significantly decreased.
- Methods involve measuring product formation or substrate depletion to determine these rates.

# Michaelis-Menten Kinetics
- Initial reaction velocity (v) depends on substrate concentration ([S]).
- At low [S], doubling [S] will double v; as [S] increases, each additional increase results in a smaller increment in v.
- Maximum velocity (Vmax) is reached when [S] becomes very large, indicating saturation.

# Vmax and Saturation
- Vmax represents the upper limit of velocity as [S] approaches infinity.
- Vmax can be increased by adding more enzyme to the reaction.
- Saturation occurs when further increases in [S] do not increase the reaction velocity beyond Vmax.

# The Michaelis-Menten Equation
- Derives the relationship between reaction velocity (v) and substrate concentration ([S]) under steady-state conditions.
- **Michaelis constant (Km)**: The concentration of substrate that gives half of the maximum velocity.

# Understanding Vmax and Km
- Vmax and Km help to understand the efficiency and capacity of enzymes:
  - **Low Km**: Enzyme effectively binds substrate at low concentrations.
  - **High Vmax**: Enzyme can process a large amount of substrate quickly.

# Substrate Concentration Scenarios
1. **Very Low Substrate Concentration ([S] << Km)**:
   - At very low [S], velocity (v) is approximately proportional to [S].
2. **Very High Substrate Concentration ([S] >> Km)**:
   - At very high [S], velocity (v) reaches Vmax, independent of further increases in [S].
3. **[S] = Km**:
   - At [S] equal to Km, the reaction velocity is half of Vmax.

# Importance of Km and Vmax to Cell Biologists
- **Km** and **Vmax** are crucial for understanding how enzymes function within the cellular context:
  - Low Km indicates high affinity for substrate.
  - Vmax indicates the maximum rate at which the enzyme can convert substrate to product.
- Estimating reaction rates under cellular conditions requires knowledge of these parameters.

# The Double-Reciprocal Plot
- A graphical representation used to determine Km and Vmax from enzyme kinetics data.
- Plot of 1/v versus 1/[S] creates a straight line, allowing easy extraction of kinetic parameters:
  - Slope = Km/Vmax
  - Y-intercept = 1/Vmax
  - X-intercept = -1/Km

# Enzyme Regulation Overview
- Enzyme activity must be finely tuned to meet cellular needs.
- Regulation occurs through various mechanisms, including:
  - Substrate-level regulation
  - Allosteric regulation (inhibitors and activators)
  - Covalent modifications (e.g., phosphorylation)
  - Proteolytic cleavage

# Competitive and Allosteric Regulation
- **Competitive Inhibition**: Inhibitors compete with substrate for binding at the enzyme's active site.
- **Allosteric Regulation**:
  - Allosteric enzymes switch between active and inactive forms.
  - Regulation involves binding of effectors at sites other than the active site, influencing enzyme activity.

# Feedback Inhibition and Activation
- **Feedback Inhibition**: The end product of a pathway negatively regulates an earlier step in the pathway.
- **Activation**: Example includes activation of protein kinase A by cAMP in response to hormones like adrenaline.
