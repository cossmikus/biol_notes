# Nucleic Acids

Nucleic acids are essential biomolecules that store, transmit, and express genetic information within a cell. They are linear polymers made up of monomeric units called nucleotides.

## Nucleotides: The Building Blocks

### Structure of Nucleotides
Each nucleotide in DNA and RNA is composed of:
- **Nitrogenous Base**: Either a purine (adenine [A] and guanine [G]) or a pyrimidine (thymine [T], cytosine [C], and uracil [U] in RNA).
- **Pentose Sugar**: Ribose in RNA and deoxyribose in DNA.
- **Phosphate Group**: One or more phosphate groups, contributing to the molecule's backbone.

### Types and Functions of Nucleotides
- **Nucleoside**: The structure containing just the sugar and base.
- **Monophosphate (NMP)**: Nucleoside with one phosphate group, e.g., Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP).
- **Diphosphate (ADP) and Triphosphate (ATP)**: Nucleotides with two and three phosphate groups, respectively, where ATP serves as the primary energy currency of the cell.

### Other Functions
- **Electron Carriers**: NADH and NADPH are crucial for redox reactions in metabolic pathways.
- **Second Messengers**: Such as cAMP and cGMP, play roles in signal transduction.
- **Enzyme Cofactors**: Components like Coenzyme A are essential for biochemical reactions including the Citric Acid Cycle.

## DNA and RNA: The Polymers

### Structure and Function
- **DNA**: Double-stranded molecule storing genetic information. Uses deoxyribose and has thymine as one of its bases.
- **RNA**: Single-stranded molecule primarily involved in the expression of genetic information. Uses ribose and has uracil instead of thymine.

### DNA's Double Helix
- **Model**: Proposed by Watson and Crick, based on X-ray diffraction data by Rosalind Franklin.
- **Features**: Consists of two antiparallel strands forming a right-handed helix. The sugar-phosphate backbone is on the outside with bases paired and stacked inside.
- **Base Pairing**: Adenine pairs with Thymine (A-T) via two hydrogen bonds; Guanine pairs with Cytosine (G-C) via three hydrogen bonds.

### Complementarity and Replication
- **Chargaffâ€™s Rules**: The amount of Adenine equals Thymine, and Guanine equals Cytosine.
- **Replication**: The complementary structure of DNA facilitates the accurate replication of genetic material.

## Historical Experiments Highlighting DNA's Role

### Griffith's Experiment
- Demonstrated the transformation of non-pathogenic bacteria into pathogenic forms, suggesting a "transforming principle."

### Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty
- Identified DNA as the "transforming principle" by demonstrating that DNA could transfer genetic information from one bacterial strain to another.

### Hershey and Chase
- Confirmed DNA as the material of heredity in viruses using radioactive labeling experiments.

## DNA Packaging in Cells

### Chromatin Structure
- **Nucleosome**: Fundamental unit of chromatin, consisting of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer.
- **Higher-Order Structures**: Chromatin further folds into higher-order structures, ultimately forming chromosomes visible during mitosis.

### Modifications and Regulation
- **Histone Modifications**: Such as acetylation and methylation, play critical roles in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure.

### Supercoiling
- **Function**: Supercoiling helps in compacting DNA and affects gene expression. Topoisomerases manage DNA's topological state during transcription and replication.

## Summary
Nucleic acids are crucial for life's genetic operations, from storing genetic blueprints in DNA to executing cellular functions with RNA. Understanding their structure, function, and interactions within cells highlights their central role in biology.

### Highlights
- "Nucleotides are versatile molecules involved in storing genetic information, energy transfer, and cellular signaling."
- "DNA's structure as a double helix is critical for its function in replication and genetic information storage."
- "Histone modifications and DNA packaging regulate access to genetic information and influence gene expression."
