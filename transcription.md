# Transcription Overview

## Gene Expression
- **Involves**: Transcription and Translation
- **Transcription**: Copying information (RNA synthesis using DNA as a template)
- **Translation**: Converting information from one language to another (protein synthesis using RNA)

## DNA and RNA Templates
- **DNA to RNA**: DNA serves as the template for RNA synthesis.
- **RNA to Protein**: RNA is the template for protein synthesis.

## Transcription Process
### Basics
- **Purpose**: Synthesize RNA from DNA.
- **Components**:
  - **Sugar difference**: Ribose in RNA, deoxyribose in DNA.
  - **Base substitution**: Uracil (U) in RNA replaces Thymine (T) in DNA.
  
### RNA Types
- **Coding (sense)**: Matches the gene sequence, oriented 5’-3’.
- **Non-coding (anti-sense)**: Complementary to the coding strand.

### Comparison with Replication
#### Similarities
  - DNA unwinds.
  - Direction: 5’ to 3’.
  - Uses one DNA strand as a template.
  
#### Differences
  - RNA transcript is single-stranded and does not remain hydrogen-bonded to DNA.
  - RNA transcripts are generally shorter than DNA.

## Transcription in Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes
- **Prokaryotes**:
  - Simpler process.
  - Operons regulate groups of genes together.
- **Eukaryotes**:
  - More complex due to chromatin structure and additional proteins required.
  - Individual genes regulated separately.

## Key Molecular Players
- **RNA Polymerases**: Enzymes that catalyze the formation of RNA.
- **Promoters**: DNA sequences that initiate transcription.

## Stages of Transcription
1. **Initiation**: RNA polymerase binds to promoter, unwinding DNA.
2. **Elongation**: RNA strand elongates as RNA polymerase moves along DNA.
3. **Termination**: RNA polymerase detaches after transcribing a termination signal.

## Specialized Features
### Prokaryotes
- **Sigma Factor**: Helps RNA polymerase recognize promoters.
- **Rho Protein**: Involved in terminating transcription.

### Eukaryotes
- **RNA Polymerase Variants**: Different RNA polymerases for different types of RNA.
- **Transcription Factors**: Proteins required for RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.
- **Chromatin Structure**: Affects accessibility of DNA for transcription.

## Post-Transcriptional Modifications (Eukaryotes)
- **Capping**: Addition of a cap to the 5' end of RNA for stability and ribosome binding.
- **Polyadenylation**: Addition of a poly-A tail to the 3' end.
- **Splicing**: Removal of introns from RNA.

## Highlights

- "Transcription is the process by which RNA is synthesized from a DNA template."
- "The promoter region determines which DNA strand is used as a template by RNA polymerase."
- "In eukaryotes, transcription and translation are spatially and temporally separated, unlike in prokaryotes."
