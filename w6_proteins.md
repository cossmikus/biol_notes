# Slide 1: Introduction to Protein Functions

## Protein-Ligand Binding
- **Binding Site**: The region of a protein that interacts with a ligand.
- **Ligands**: Include neurotransmitters, antigens, substrates, drugs, DNA/RNA, ions, etc.
- **Protein Types**: Can be enzymes, antibodies, receptors, transporters, etc.
- **Binding Specificity**: Proteins bind other molecules with high specificity and the interaction is transient.

# Slide 2: Functions of Binding Sites

## Key Functions
1. **Self-Assembly**: Facilitates the assembly of functional proteins or structures within or outside the cell.
2. **Membrane Receptor Interaction**: Allows for the interaction of a membrane receptor with its ligand.
3. **Enzyme-Substrate Interaction**: Facilitates the interaction between an enzyme and its substrate, e.g., lysozyme binding to a section of a polysaccharide wall.
4. **Antibody-Antigen Interaction**: Enables the interaction of antibodies with antigens.

# Slide 3: Protein-Ligand Interaction Quantitatively

## Equilibrium and Affinity
- **Equation**: \(P + L \leftrightarrow PL\)
- **Association Constant (Ka)**: Describes the equilibrium between the complex (PL) and unbound components (P and L), with units in M\(^{-1}\). A higher Ka indicates stronger binding.
- **Dissociation Constant (Kd)**: The inverse of Ka, given in M, µM, etc. It represents the ligand concentration at which half of the binding sites are occupied.

# Slide 4: Calculating Occupied Binding Sites

## Fraction of Occupied Ligand-Binding Sites (θ)
- **Equation**: \(\theta = \frac{[PL]}{[PL] + [P]}\)
- Rearranging Ka gives: \([PL] = Ka[P][L]\)
- \(\theta = \frac{Ka \cdot P \cdot [L]}{Ka \cdot P \cdot [L] + [P]}\)
- Simplified: \(\theta = \frac{[L]}{[L] + 1/Ka} = \frac{[L]}{[L] + Kd}\)
- When \([L] = Kd\), then \(\theta = \frac{1}{2}\) (50% of sites are occupied).

# Slide 5: Graphical Representation of Ligand Binding

## Understanding Kd and Ka
- **Affinity**: Higher Ka or lower Kd indicates higher affinity.
- **Graphical Analysis**: A sigmoidal plot can reveal Kd and help compare the binding strengths of different ligands.
- **Homework Examples**:
  - Calculate ligand concentration when half of the binding sites are occupied given Ka.
  - Determine the fraction of protein bound at a specific ligand concentration.
  - Find ligand concentration required for 90% binding site occupancy and relate it to Kd.

# Slide 6: Amino Acids and Binding

## Questions on Amino Acids
- Identify amino acids that provide minimal steric hindrance, are positively charged at physiological pH, have aromatic R groups, participate in hydrophobic interactions, and those important in enzyme active sites near neutral pH.

# Slide 7: Peptide Sequences and Properties

## Analyzing Peptides
- Determine sequences from abbreviations like STYDENT, VIRATEGY, NAME.
- Compare properties and pI values for peptides like EDILVED and ARKHA.
- Discuss common features of amino acids like threonine and tyrosine.

# Slide 8: True/False Questions

## Evaluating Statements on Amino Acids
- Address true/false questions concerning amino acid properties at different pH levels, their role as buffers, and the biological significance of their pKa values relative to physiological pH.

# Slide 9: Estimating pI of Peptides

## Practical Application
- Estimate the isoelectric point of given peptides.
- Discuss the charge states of a tripeptide (Gly-Asp-Glu) at various pH levels (1, 7, 11), exploring its behavior in different environments.
